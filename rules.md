# Game Description

## Basic Premise
The game is based loosely on a board game known as 
"Betrayal at the house on the hill". Our game 
takes place in a haunted mansion where you spawn in
as characters that have different stats.
Your objective is to explore the house, triggering
different "Events". These events may give you an item, 
which will award you with stat bonus. It could also be 
an event where you need to roll a dice to clear an 
obstacle or else you might lose some stat.

## Winning or losing the game
After 8 events have been triggered in total, a haunt will begin.
This will turn the last person to trigger an event insane.
The insane players objective is to hunt down and kill the 
non insane players in combat. Combat is triggered by stepping
on to the same tile as a non haunted player and vice versa.
The haunted player wins when they are the only one left alive.
The non haunted players win by finding one of four escape hatches
that spawn randomly on the map once the haunt is triggered.

## The main game
### Movement
In the top right of the screen it will display the current players characters name 
and stats. To move press the buttons corresponding to the direction you wish to move in.

### Stats
Your stats have different effects on the mechanics of the game. Regardless of the 
specific effects of your stats they also play a hand in the Event mechanic.
Depending on whta type of event you have triggered you may be asked to "roll" 
on a certain stats. This represented by a random number being generated
from zero to that specific stat value on your character. Rolling higher or
lower than a certain threshold may have an effect on your stats or position. 
If any of yout stats go to zero, either from events or combat, you will die.

#### Speed
The speed stat impacts
how many steps you can take in one turn. You roll your "speed stat dice" this 
being a random number from zero to your speed stat and the result is how
many steps you may take in one turn. 

#### Strength
The strength stat plays a role in the combat mechanic of the game, which only
comes in to play after a player has gone insane. Here both of the players
in combat will "roll" on their strength stat and the difference will result
in the damage dealt to the non haunted player.

#### Stamina
The stamina stat represents your characters hitpoints. Even though any
stat going to zero will result in the death of your character, this
stat will be the one taking damage during combat

#### Sanity
sanity has no specif effect or responsibility unlike the others and 
will merely be used generally to roll on or being increased or decreased
by events.
