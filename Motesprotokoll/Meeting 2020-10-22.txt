Chair: Erik
Participants: Karl Gunnarsson, David Andreasson, Jakob Ristner, Jakob Henriksson, Erik Berg


#####Objectives(5 min)
- Finish up RAD
- Finish up SDD
- Finish up UML
- Make sure that the maven jar is executable from the console. 
- make sure the application has full coverage in the model.

######### Reports(15 min)
The UML is almost complete only minor things still left there. Same goes for RAD, but the SDD still needs some work
to be able to hand it in. 

####### Discussion Items(35 min)
Discussion about maven. It works if the jar file is executed from the correct path so it is close to working. 
Maven is now supposed to work on all windows machines at least. 

Discussion about tests. How are we supposed to run tests on a method which makes a call to an observer? After a bit 
of discussion we ended up making the decision to create a dummy class inside the test method that can act as an observer
but the dummy class doesn't actually do anything. 

Discussion about tests. How do we test something that depends on probabilities? It is hard to test something random. 
Should we write a junit test anyways and just make sure that the probability that the test fails is miniscule or should
we just not write the test?. We can test the things that we actually can test such as edge cases where e.g the combat
shouldn't give the players stats. 

Discussion about refactoring the code so that the name RollDiceEvent better reflects what the code actually does. 
RollDiceEvent currently rolls a stat to make a statChange and it would probably be a better name to name it StatChangeEvent.
However due to time constraints we have decided not to refactor the entire code because of a not so stellar name choice.
Instead we'll just keep the name. 


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
RAD is almost finished, only need a read-through.

SDD needs few more hours work.

The application is finished. Maybe a few more tests could be written. 


## Wrap up
Next meeting at 10 tomorrow.
