######### Reports(15 min)
-Peer review finished.
-First version of Rad, SSD has been finished.



####### Discussion Items(35 min)
-What should the eventFactory look like?- Three different methods to avoid checking strings, specific constructors have yet to be specified because we are not
finished with the xml parser yet. 
-Structure of the xml parser-resulted in having multiple data classes.
-Adding "getEventType" to EventInterface so that the view can know which event has been triggered (in case we add a button). Will check ints from XML to check which
event has been triggered.
-Boolean with side effect or not? -decided not to, goes against an oop principle.


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
-Continue working on gameScreen
-Continue working on event structure
-Continue working on xml-parser
-Continue working on game logic (haunt states)

Next meeting is with the supervisor.
