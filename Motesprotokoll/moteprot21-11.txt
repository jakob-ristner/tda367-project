##Objectives##

    *Win condition checker
    *Some bugs crashing the game
    *Stairs
    *UML and SDD
    *Finishing touches

##Discussion Items##
    Discussed how the stairs should be represented in the model and 
    where they should be places. Since there is not much time left 
    we talked about what aspects of the game should be prioritised. The
    Result being that we agreed on functionality being first priority and
    good intuitive visual representation being less of one.
    Not much more discussion, mostly just 
    working and trying to finish the project. 

##Objectives & assignments##
    *Karl works on updating UML diagram and SDD
    *The rest of us are fixing bugs and implementing features
