##Objectives

- Todays goal is a functional character select screen by one group. Another
  group is refactoring the floors to matrices instead of one dimensional lists.

## Reports
- Have not done anything since last meeting

## Outcomes and assignments
We created a character select and start screen, very rudimentary but functional, also created a way to link views that are going to be sequential.

we need to fix the uml due to a few changes in the relationship between view and controller and model to some extent
