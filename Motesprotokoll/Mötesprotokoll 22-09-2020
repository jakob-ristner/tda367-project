##Discussion items

-Creating a toggle method in "Tiles" class so that when "the haunt" happens, we can toggle off the illuminate.
-Should floor be a class or not? Conclusion->Yes, there is multiple methods that can be used in floor.(etc generateStairs)
-How do we couple tiles with events? Put them on random locations, we need to randomize without picking the same tile again.
 Conclusion: Create a list with the size of each floor in numeric order, randomize the indexes and with that you can use 
 setEvent(); in tiles.
-Removed characterFactory since we don't have any abstraktion of character. 
-Can we have multiples of the same event? On each floor? No, we want the game to be randomized.
-
