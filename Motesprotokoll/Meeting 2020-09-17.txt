Meeting 2020-09-17

Group: Gastuen
Chair: Erik Berg
Participants: Karl Gunnarsson, Erik Berg, Jakob Henriksson, Jakob Ristner, David Andreasson

#######Objectives##########

* Finish first draft of UML
* Finish first draft of RAD
* Look into MVC vs MVP
* Create TODO-list for start of programming

###### Reports from previous meeting #####
Started UML. 

####### Discussion Items #########

Discussion about observer pattern between PLayer class and Board class. Decided against using the pattern because 
of the Gastuen class which already connects the two classes. 

Discussion about event handling: Template method pattern vs Strategy pattern. Strategy patter can be used during
runtime. Probably going for strategy pattern

Discussion regarding views. How are the views supposed to be set up? Many different views for each task? 
An abstract class which collects all the views? 

Discussion regarding stats: Have a stats class? The class is then supposed to add stats. The ENUM is wrong and we 
need to change it. Why do we want an Enum? An enum can only represent one of the stats. Therefore a class would be
better. Or should we just skip enum and class and have the stats only in the character. 
Decision: Use the enum only for telling which stat is supposed to be changed. The character class holds the stats 
and is responsible for the handling of the stats. 

Discussion about strategy and events. At first we had a lot of classes for all the different events we imagined. 
Then we realised that the functionality is the same and therefore one class is sufficient. How the stats are 
determined is decided by an XML file or similiar, same with the text that is supposed to be shown. 

Discussion: EventFactory or ItemFactory.
