##### Meeting Agenda

Group: Gastuen
Date: 2020-09-30
Chair: Erik
Participants: Karl Gunnarsson, David Andreasson, Jakob Ristner, Jakob Henriksson, Erik Berg


#####Objectives(5 min)
- Update UML so that it corresponds with the actual code. 
- Finish up RAD.
- Plan ahead for next week and set up goals for the next iteration.


######### Reports(15 min)
Last meeting was about a lot of coding. A Start Screen was created and also a character select screen was made. 
The tile and floor classes were refactored to better reflect the model. 

####### Discussion Items(35 min)
Is it relevant that all the controllers and all the views has a Game dependency?
Maybe it isn't....


The ViewInterface is maybe a little bit too big. Or at least shouldn't get bigger. We should split the interface into 
two so that the methods setNextView and nextView is in a separate interface. That way there will (hopefully) be no 
empty or redundant methods in the games. 


What has been done with maven so far? Nothing. What do we have maven for? We have it for the hand-in. 

Also a few questions we need to address with the supervisor:
* All the buttons is being drawn in the Controller class - good/bad
* All the controllers and Views have dependencies on the Game class - probably bad?
* We also probably need some general MVC help.


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
The model part of the UML still needs some updating. 

The RAD is almost finished and needs to be finish at the latest by thursday. 


## Wrap up
Next meeting after Lunch. Then the next meeting is the meeting with the supervisor.
