######### Reports(15 min)
Last meeting was about a lot of coding. A Start Screen was created and also a character select screen was made. 
The tile and floor classes were refactored to better reflect the model. 

####### Discussion Items(35 min)
Is it relevant that all the controllers and all the views has a Game dependency?
Maybe it isn't....


The ViewInterface is maybe a little bit too big. Or at least shouldn't get bigger. We should split the interface into 
two so that the methods setNextView and nextView is in a separate interface. That way there will (hopefully) be no 
empty or redundant methods in the games. 


What has been done with maven so far? Nothing. What do we have maven for? We have it for the hand-in. 

## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
