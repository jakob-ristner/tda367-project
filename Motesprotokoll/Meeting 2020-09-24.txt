# Meeting Agenda

Group: Gastuen
Date: 2020-09-24
Chair: Karl
Participants: Karl Gunnarsson, David Andreasson, Jakob Ristner, Jakob Henriksson, Erik Berg


## Objectives (5 min) 

- Discuss pattern design for haunt, create new UML, try to prototype some code
- Create a view with a controller


## Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

- Try to decide what pattern to use for haunts, summarize thoughts and ideas from the statepattern idea.
- Discuss how to implement MVC for our project.


## Discussion items (35 min)

- Decided to make a protype of statePattern anyways. The idea is to combine the state pattern for the haunts with a decorator pattern.
decided to remove the state prehaunt state, and instead implement the "prehaunt" functionality in the Game class, then delegate the extra functionaly to
the different state classes. 

-MVC: If you press a button -> actionevent, this should happen in controller not in the view. Problem right now is that buttons can't be in view
because if you would you would get action events in view. Decided to send buttons through a method that is implemented by all views trhough and interface. 


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)

- Next problem for MVC: Can only have one button/view. Alternative, create hashmap with ID, or create more classe. We have not found a solution that we are
satisfied with. 
-Continue working on state pattern, might try to combine it with a decorator pattern inte the future. 


## Wrap up
